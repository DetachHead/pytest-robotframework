# pytest-robotframework

a pytest plugin that can run both python and robotframework tests while generating robot reports for them

![](https://github.com/DetachHead/pytest-robotframework/assets/57028336/9caabc2e-450e-4db6-bb63-e149a38d49a2)

## install

pytest should automatically find and activate the plugin once you install it.

```
pdm add pytest-robotframework --dev
```

## features

### write robot tests in python

```py
# you can use both robot and pytest features
from robot.api import logger
from pytest import Cache

from pytest_robotframework import keyword

@keyword  # make this function show as a keyword in the robot log
def foo():
    ...

@mark.slow  # gets converted to robot tags
def test_foo(cache: Cache):
    foo()
```

### run `.robot` tests

to allow for gradual adoption, the plugin also runs regular robot tests as well:

```robot
*** Settings ***
test setup  setup

*** Test Cases ***
bar
    [Tags]  asdf  key:value
    no operation

*** Keywords ***
setup
    log  ran setup
```

which is roughly equivalent to the following python code:

```py
# conftest.py
from robot.api import logger
from pytest_robotframework import keyword

def pytest_runtet_setup():
    foo()

@keyword
def foo():
    logger.info("ran setup")
```

```py
# test_foo.py
from pytest import mark

@mark.asdf
@mark.key("value")
def test_bar():
    ...
```

### setup/teardown and other hooks

to define a function that runs for each test at setup or teardown, create a `conftest.py` with a `pytest_runtest_setup` and/or `pytest_runtest_teardown` function:

```py
# ./tests/conftest.py
def pytest_runtest_setup():
    log_in()
```

```py
# ./tests/test_suite.py
def test_something():
    """i am logged in now"""
```

these hooks appear in the log the same way that the a `.robot` file's `Setup` and `Teardown` options in `*** Settings ***` would:

for more information, see [writing hook functions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html). pretty much every pytest hook should work with this plugin
but i haven't tested them all. please raise an issue if you find one that's broken.

### tags/markers

pytest markers are converted to tags in the robot log:

```py
from pytest import mark

@mark.slow
def test_blazingly_fast_sorting_algorithm():
    [1,2,3].sort()
```

![](https://github.com/DetachHead/pytest-robotframework/assets/57028336/f25ee4bd-2f10-42b4-bdef-18a22379bd0d)

markers like `skip`, `skipif` and `parameterize` also work how you'd expect:

```py
from pytest import mark

@mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", [(1, 8), (6, 6)])
def test_eval(test_input: int, expected: int):
    assert test_input == expected
```

### listeners

you can define listeners in your `conftest.py` and decorate them with `@listener` to register them as global listeners:

```py
# conftest.py
from pytest_robotframework import listener
from robot import model, result
from robot.api.interfaces import ListenerV3
from typing_extensions import override

@listener
class Listener(ListenerV3):
    @override
    def start_test(self, data: model.TestCase result: result.TestCase):
        ...
```

### robot suite variables

to set suite-level robot variables, call the `set_variables` function at the top of the test suite:

```py
from robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn
from pytest_robotframework import set_variables

set_variables(
    {
        "foo": "bar",
        "baz": ["a", "b"],
    }
)

def test_variables():
    assert BuiltIn().get_variable_value("$foo") == "bar"
```

`set_variables` is equivalent to the `*** Variables ***` section in a `.robot` file. all variables are prefixed with `$`. `@` and `&` are not required since `$` variables can store lists and dicts anyway

## config

since this is a pytest plugin, you should avoid using robot options that have pytest equivalents:

| instead of...                                 | use...                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `robot --include tag_name`                    | `pytest -m tag_name`                                                                                                                                                              |
| `robot --skip tag_name`                       | `pytest -m "not tag_name"`                                                                                                                                                        |
| `robot --test "test name" path/to/test.robot` | `pytest path/to/test.robot::"Test Name"`                                                                                                                                          |
| `robot --listener Foo`                        | [`@listener` decorator](#listeners)                                                                                                                                               |
| `robot --dryrun`                              | `pytest --collect-only` (not exactly the same. you should use [a type checker](https://github.com/kotlinisland/basedmypy) on your python tests as a replacement for robot dryrun) |
| `robot --exitonfailure`                       | `pytest --maxfail=1`                                                                                                                                                              |
| `robot --rerunfailed`                         | `pytest --lf`                                                                                                                                                                     |

if the robot option you want to use isn't mentioned here, check the pytest [command line options](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html#command-line-flags) and [ini options](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html#configuration-options) for a complete list of pytest settings as there are probably many missing from this list.

### specifying robot options directlty

there are multiple ways you can specify the robot arguments directly. however, arguments that have pytest equivalents should not be set with robot as they will probably cause the plugin to behave incorrectly.

#### `pytest_robot_modify_args` hook

you can specify a `pytest_robot_modify_args` hook in your `conftest.py` to programmatically modify the arguments

```py
def pytest_robot_modify_args(args: list[str], collect_only: bool, session: Session) -> None:
    if not collect_only:
        args.extend(["--listener", "Foo"])
```

note that not all arguments that the plugin passes to robot will be present in the `args` list. arguments required for the plugin to function (eg. the plugin's listeners and prerunmodifiers) cannot be viewed or modified with this hook

#### `--robotargs` pytest argument

```
pytest --robotargs="-d results --listener foo.Foo"
```

#### `ROBOT_OPTIONS` environment variable

```
ROBOT_OPTIONS="-d results --listener foo.Foo"
```

### enabling pytest assertions in the robot log

by default, only failed assertions will appear in the log. to make passed assertions show up, you'll have to add `enable_assertion_pass_hook = true` to your pytest ini options:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
enable_assertion_pass_hook = true
```

## limitations with python tests

there are several limitations with using robotframework without the language that this plugin includes workarounds for

### making keywords show in the robot log

by default when writing tests in python, the only keywords that you'll see in the robot log are `Setup`, `Run Test` and `Teardown`. this is because robot is not capable of recognizing keywords called outside of robot code. (see [this issue](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252))

this plugin has several workarounds for the problem:

#### `@keyword` decorator

if you want a function you wrote to show up as a keyword in the log, decorate it with the `pytest_robotframework.keyword` instead of `robot.api.deco.keyword`

```py
from pytest_robotframework import keyword

@keyword
def foo():
    ...
```

#### pytest functions are patched by the plugin

most of the [pytest functions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/reference/reference.html#functions) are patched so that they show as keywords in the robot log

```py
def test_foo():
    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        logger.info(1 / 0)
```

#### patching third party functions with `keywordify`

if you want a function from a third party module/robot library to be displayed as a keyword, you can patch it with the `keywordify` function:

```py
# in your conftest.py

from pyest_robotframework import keywordify
import some_module

# patch a function from the module:
keywordify(some_module, "some_function")
# works on classes too:
keywordify(some_module.SomeClass, "some_method")
```

### `run_keyword_and_continue_on_failure` doesn't continue after the failure

some robot keywords such as `run_keyword_and_continue_on_failure` don't work properly when called from python code.

use a `try`/`except` statement to handle expected failures instead:

```py
try:
    some_keyword_that_fails()
except SomeException:
    ... # ignore the exception, or re-raise it later
```

the keyword will still show as failed in the log (as long as it's decorated with `pytest_robotframework.keyword`), but it won't effect the status of the test unless the exception is re-raised
